# ecc_tutorials
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) beginner tutorials in Python 3
#### Instructions
Just download the repo and read the tutorial files!
#### Notes
* These tutorials are made with Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency in mind, but not too much. The ubiquity of ECC means that these tutorials must also be applicable to other cryptocurrencies.
* These tutorials only cover working with ECC *in general*. Things specific to the ed25519 curve (the curve used here) like elliptic curve description, cofactor consideration, etc. are not included.
* **For educational purposes only!**
